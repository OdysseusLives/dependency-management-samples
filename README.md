# Dependency Management Sample Projects

This repository holds several sample Gradle projects which demonstrate how to use experimental dependency management
features that are currently under development. To try a sample project, cd into the project folder 
`samples/<sample-name>` and explore the `build.gradle` file or start a build:

- Run `./gradlew dependencies` to print the dependency resolution result
- Run `./gradlew build --scan` and inspect the dependencies in a build scan
