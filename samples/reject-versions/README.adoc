## Rejecting dependency versions

It is possible to declare that a dependency version should be rejected. For example, if a bug is discovered, you might
want to prevent a dependency from being upgraded.

```
dependencies {
    implementation('org:foo') {
        version {
            prefer '1.0.1'
            reject '1.0.2'
        }
    }
}
```

Multiple rejections are possible (but only a single preferred version).
