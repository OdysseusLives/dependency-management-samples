# Support for Maven optional dependencies

Gradle now takes Maven optional dependencies into account during dependency resolution. Before, optional dependencies
were not included in the dependency graph. Now, optional dependencies will participate in dependency resolution as soon
as another dependency on the same module is found in the graph.

For example, if a transitive dependency on `foo:bar:1.1` is optional, but another path in the dependency graph brings
`foo:bar:1.0` (not optional), then Gradle will resolve to `foo:bar:1.1`. Previous releases would resolve to
`foo:bar:1.0`. However, if no "hard" dependency is found on the optional module, then it will not be included,
as previous Gradle versions did.
