## Importing Maven Bill of Materials (BOMs)

Gradle now supports the import of BOMs by declaring them as dependencies. 
Each `<dependencyManagement>` entry in the BOM will be applied as a dependency constraint to the consuming project.
This allows the consuming project to declare dependencies without versions and using a BOM to derive a set of compatible versions. 

### Spring boot example

```
dependencies {
    // Import the Spring Boot BOM
    implementation "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies:1.5.8.RELEASE" 

    implementation "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot"
    implementation "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure"

    testImplementation "junit:junit"
    testImplementation "org.springframework:spring-test"
    testImplementation "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-test"
    testImplementation "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-test-autoconfigure"
}
```

Note that the BOM dependency will be included when the project is published, and the dependency constraints from the BOM will be available transitively.
