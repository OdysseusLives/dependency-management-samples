## Modify dependency constraints in component metadata rules

Component metadata rules also support adding and removing dependency constraints. This also works if the metadata
is sourced from a format (e.g. a POM file) that does not support constraints as such.

```
dependencies {
     components {
         // if 'org:example' is part of my dependency tree and 'commons-codec' is added, use at least version 1.10
         withModule('org:example') {
             withVariant('default') {
                 withDependencyConstraints { dc ->
                     add 'commons-codec:commons-codec:1.10'
                 }
             }
         }
     }
 }
```

Note: Maven optional dependencies defined in a POM are exposed as dependency constraints.
