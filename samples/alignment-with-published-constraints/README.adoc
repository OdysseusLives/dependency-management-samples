## Alignment with published constraints

This sample shows how one would configure a build to produce a set of libraries that need to be aligned on the same version.

The libraries are produced through a multi project build in `aligned`.

The consuming sample is in `consumer`.

The `repo` contains 4 versions of the libraries: `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, `2.0`.
