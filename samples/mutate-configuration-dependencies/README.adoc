It is now possible to provide a rule(s) to modify the dependencies of a configuration before it is used. See here for motivation

This method allows plugin to provide logic that adds/removes/modifies the set of dependencies for a project configuration. Each `withDependencies` action will be evaluated before the configuration is consumed: for resolution, publishing or other purpose. Actions will evaluated only once per build execution, and will be deferred until the configuration is actually used.

Use cases
The nebula.dependency-recommender and io.spring.dependency-management plugins use the beforeResolve hook to provide versions for declared dependencies of a project. The modified versions should automatically be included wherever that project is consumed, whether by project dependency, composite build or published metadata.
Build logic provides dependency information for a project that is expensive to calculate. This calculation should not be performed until dependencies are actually required for resolution or publishing.

configurations.compile.withDependencies { deps ->
   def foo = deps.find { it.name == 'foo' }
   assert foo.version == null
   foo.version { prefer '1.0' }

   def bar = deps.find { it.name == 'bar' }
   assert bar.version == '2.2'
   bar.version { prefer null }
}

This functionality should replace the use of `configuration.incoming.beforeResolve`, in many dependency management plugins. The benefits of `withDependencies` over `beforeResolve` are:
The rule applies to the declaring configuration rather than the resolving configuration. This means that it's not necessary to use `configurations.all*.` to have a rule that will apply to the all extending configurations.
Dependency modifications will be included when publishing using `ivy-publish` or `maven-publish`
Dependency mutations will be applied when a configuration is consumed as a project dependency. (With `beforeResolve`, all consuming projects would need to apply the same mutation rules)
Dependency mutations will be applied when a project configuration is consumed as part of a composite build. (Removing the need for the consuming build to apply the mutation rules).
