## Dependency constraints

Dependency constraints are a mechanism to express constraints over transitive dependencies. The are used during
dependency resolution of a build and are also published when the Gradle module metadata format is used. They cover
the functionality of maven optional dependencies and more. For example, they can be combined with strict versions or
version rejections.

```
configurations { core; confA { extendsFrom core }; confB { extendsFrom core } }

dependencies {
    // commons-code will is set to 1.10 for confA by the constraint
    // confB has no dependency and the constraint has no effect

    confA 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5.3'
    constraints {
        core('commons-codec:commons-codec') {
            version { strictly '1.10' }
        }
    }
}

```
