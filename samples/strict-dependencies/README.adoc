## Strict Dependencies

Strict dependencies allow a component to tell that a dependency version is strict, meaning that if any other version
for the same dependency module is found in the dependency graph, and that this version disagrees with the strict
version, then resolution will fail.

Strict dependencies can be declared using the version DSL:

```
dependencies {
    conf('org:foo') {
       version {
          strictly '1.0' // declares a strict dependency
       }
    }
}
```

It is possible to declare strict version ranges:

```
dependencies {
    conf('org:foo') {
       version {
          // any version in the 1.x range
          strictly '[1.0, 2.0('
       }
    }
}
```

Itâ€™s worth noting that strict dependencies are resolved for a project or transitively between local projects. However,
publishing those constraints is not possible with Ivy or Maven metadata file formats. Both publishing and resolving
strict constraints require the experimental Gradle metadata format.
