## Control metadata sources for a repository

When searching for a module in a repository, Gradle will check for all supported metadata file formats for that repository.

- In Gradle 5.x, this will include searching for a Gradle `.module` metadata file
- In all versions, this includes searching for a `.pom` or `ivy.xml` file (depending on repository type)
- In Gradle 4.x, this includes searching for a `jar` file without supporting metadata. 

Searching for all possible metadata files is inefficient when a repository is well formed and uses a consistent metadata format. It is now possible to configure the metadata sources for a repository, and Gradle will only look for files for the configured sources. This will permit Gradle 5.x users to opt-in to searching for `jar` files and/or opt-out of searching for default metadata files.

The order of checking for sources is not configurable.

### Example

The `metadataSources` can be configured at the repository level:

```
repositories {
     maven {
         url â€¦
         metadataSources {
             gradleMetadata() // Look for Gradle `.module` metadata files
             mavenPom() // Look for Maven `.pom` files
             // artifact() // Do not look for an artifact without an associated metadata file
         }
     }
}
```

### Notes

There are currently 4 configurable sources of metadata:

- `gradleMetadata()` is the new experimental Gradle metadata file
- `mavenPom()` is used to look for Maven POM files
- `ivyDescriptor()` is used to look for Ivy descriptor files
- `artifact()` is the legacy behavior, looking for an artifact

Note that `gradleMetadata()` will have no effect if experimental features are not enabled.
