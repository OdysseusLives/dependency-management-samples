## Declaring incompatibility with a module

It is also possible to reject all versions of a module in a dependency constraint. Such dependency constraints can be
used to declare incompatibilities between modules. For example, if having 2 different modules on classpath would
introduce a compile or runtime error, it is possible to declare that they are incompatible, which would lead to a
resolution error if they happen to be found in the same dependency graph:

```
dependencies {
    constraints {
        implementation('org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all') {
            version { rejectAll() }
        }
    }
}
```
